"""
Fix for metamodel prediction collapse issue.
The model outputs nearly constant values (~0.554) regardless of input.
"""

# Key fixes needed:
# 1. Add residual connections to prevent gradient vanishing
# 2. Use better activation functions (swish instead of relu)
# 3. Add layer normalization
# 4. Adjust learning rate schedule
# 5. Remove or reduce dropout in early layers

# Modified architecture suggestions:

)
    # Use swish activation instead of relu
    # Add layer normalization after attention
    # Use residual connections in decoder
    # Initialize weights with smaller variance
end
"""

# Training improvements:
"""
1. Use cosine annealing learning rate schedule
2. Add gradient clipping
3. Monitor prediction variance during training
4. Use larger batch sizes (256 instead of 64)
5. Train longer with patience (don't stop at epoch 7)
"""

# Data augmentation:
"""
1. Add noise to feature masks during training
2. Use mixup or similar regularization
3. Generate more diverse training samples
"""

# Alternative approach - simpler model:
"""
Instead of complex attention mechanism, try:
1. Simple MLP with skip connections
2. Feature interaction layers (element-wise products)
3. Ensemble of smaller models
