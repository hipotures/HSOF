# Stage 1 Output Integration and Feature Indexing System

## Overview

The Stage 1 Integration system provides a comprehensive interface layer that bridges Stage 1's feature selection output with Stage 2's GPU-MCTS operations. This system handles the critical transition from Stage 1's 500 selected features to efficient indexing and state management for MCTS tree operations.

## Key Components

### 1. Feature Metadata Management
- **FeatureMetadata**: Complete metadata structure for each selected feature
- **Stage1Output**: Container for all Stage 1 selection results and metadata
- Supports multiple file formats (JSON, HDF5, JLD2) for flexible data exchange

### 2. Feature Indexing System
- **FeatureIndexer**: Efficient bidirectional mappings between original IDs and Stage 2 indices
- Multiple lookup strategies: by original ID, Stage 2 index, or feature name
- Optimized grouping by importance, correlation, and feature type
- Built-in caching for high-frequency operations

### 3. Feature State Tracking
- **FeatureStateTracker**: Real-time tracking of feature selection/deselection
- Support for multiple concurrent MCTS trees with independent state
- Historical state tracking with configurable limits
- Performance monitoring and cache optimization

### 4. Integration Interface
- **Stage1IntegrationInterface**: Main coordination layer with thread-safe operations
- Comprehensive validation and consistency checking
- Performance monitoring and error handling
- Status reporting and state persistence

## Architecture Details

### Feature Metadata Structure

```julia
struct FeatureMetadata
    original_id::Int                     # Original feature ID in full dataset
    stage1_rank::Int                     # Ranking position in Stage 1 selection (1-500)
    name::String                         # Feature name/identifier
    feature_type::String                 # "numeric", "categorical", "binary", etc.
    importance_score::Float64            # Importance score from Stage 1 (0.0-1.0)
    selection_confidence::Float64        # Confidence in selection decision (0.0-1.0)
    correlation_group::Union{Int, Nothing}  # Group ID for correlated features
    preprocessing_info::Dict{String, Any}   # Normalization, encoding details
    source_stage::String                 # Source: "xgboost", "random_forest", "correlation"
    timestamp_selected::DateTime         # When this feature was selected
end
```

### Indexing System Mappings

The feature indexer maintains multiple efficient mappings:

1. **Core Mappings**:
   - `original_to_stage2`: Original ID → Stage 2 index (1-500)
   - `stage2_to_original`: Stage 2 index → Original ID
   - `name_to_stage2`: Feature name → Stage 2 index
   - `stage2_to_name`: Stage 2 index → Feature name

2. **Organizational Mappings**:
   - `importance_ranking`: Stage 2 indices sorted by importance (descending)
   - `correlation_groups`: Group ID → Vector of Stage 2 indices
   - `type_groups`: Feature type → Vector of Stage 2 indices

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - `feature_lookup_cache`: LRU cache for frequent lookups
   - `index_validation`: Validation status per feature

### State Tracking System

The feature state tracker provides:

1. **Global State Management**:
   - Current selection status for all 500 features
   - Historical tracking of state changes with timestamps
   - Configurable history limits for memory efficiency

2. **Tree-Specific States**:
   - Independent feature states per MCTS tree
   - Node-level caching for MCTS operations
   - Efficient state synchronization

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Cache hit/miss ratios
   - State change frequency tracking
   - Validation and consistency metrics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization and Setup

```julia
using Stage1Integration

# Initialize interface with configuration
config = create_stage1_integration_config(
    validation_enabled = true,
    caching_enabled = true,
    performance_monitoring = true
)

interface = initialize_stage1_interface(config)

# Load Stage 1 output (supports JSON, HDF5, JLD2)
load_stage1_output(interface, "stage1_output.json")

# Build feature indexer
build_feature_indexer(interface)

# Initialize state tracker
initialize_state_tracker(interface)
```

### Feature Lookup Operations

```julia
# Get Stage 2 index from original feature ID
stage2_idx = get_stage2_index(interface, original_id)

# Get original ID from Stage 2 index
original_id = get_original_id(interface, stage2_idx)

# Get Stage 2 index by feature name
stage2_idx = get_stage2_index_by_name(interface, "feature_name")

# Get complete feature metadata
metadata = get_feature_metadata(interface, stage2_idx)
```

### MCTS Integration Operations

```julia
# Select features for MCTS tree operations
update_feature_state!(interface, feature_idx, true, tree_id=1)

# Get current feature states (global or tree-specific)
global_states = get_feature_states(interface)
tree_states = get_feature_states(interface, tree_id=1)

# Query features by various criteria
top_features = get_top_features(interface, 50)  # Top 50 by importance
correlation_group = get_correlation_group(interface, group_id)
numeric_features = get_features_by_type(interface, "numeric")
```

### Validation and Monitoring

```julia
# Validate system consistency
validate_feature_consistency!(interface)

# Generate comprehensive status report
report = generate_status_report(interface)
println(report)

# Save interface state for checkpointing
save_interface_state(interface, "interface_checkpoint.jld2")
```

## Performance Characteristics

## Configuration Options

### Default Configuration

```julia
config = create_stage1_integration_config(
    validation_enabled = true,         # Enable data validation
    caching_enabled = true,           # Enable lookup caching
    performance_monitoring = true,    # Track performance metrics
    cache_size_limit = 10000,        # Max cache entries
    state_history_limit = 1000,      # Max state history entries
    consistency_check_frequency = 100, # Validation frequency
    error_log_limit = 500            # Max error log entries
)
```

### Performance Tuning

For high-performance scenarios:
```julia
# High-throughput configuration
high_perf_config = create_stage1_integration_config(
    caching_enabled = true,
    cache_size_limit = 50000,        # Larger cache
    state_history_limit = 100,       # Reduced history
    consistency_check_frequency = 1000, # Less frequent validation
    performance_monitoring = false   # Disable monitoring overhead
)
```

For memory-constrained environments:
```julia
# Low-memory configuration
low_mem_config = create_stage1_integration_config(
    caching_enabled = false,          # Disable caching
    state_history_limit = 10,         # Minimal history
    consistency_check_frequency = 10, # Frequent validation
    error_log_limit = 50             # Smaller error log
)
```

## Integration with MCTS

### Feature Selection Workflow

1. **Initialize Interface**: Load Stage 1 output and build indexer
2. **Create MCTS Tree**: Assign unique tree ID
3. **Feature Evaluation**: Query features by importance/correlation/type
4. **State Management**: Update feature selection states per tree
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor cache performance and consistency

### Example MCTS Integration

```julia
# MCTS-style feature selection workflow
function mcts_feature_selection(interface, tree_id, selection_strategy)
    # Get candidate features based on strategy
    candidates = if selection_strategy == :importance
        get_top_features(interface, 100)
    elseif selection_strategy == :correlation
        get_correlation_group(interface, group_id)
    elseif selection_strategy == :type_balanced
        vcat(
            get_features_by_type(interface, "numeric")[1:50],
            get_features_by_type(interface, "categorical")[1:30],
            get_features_by_type(interface, "binary")[1:20]
        )
    end
    
    # Select features for this tree
    for (feature_idx, metadata) in candidates[1:min(50, length(candidates))]
        update_feature_state!(interface, feature_idx, true, tree_id=tree_id)
    end
    
    # Return current tree state
    return get_feature_states(interface, tree_id=tree_id)
end
```
